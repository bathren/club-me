The art stresses dynamic, elegant throws, upholding finesse and, as a fundamental principle, the achievement of maximum efficiency with minimal effort. Through traditional and modern training methods, members perfect the art, improve their fitness, and foster close relationships with each other. The purpose of the organization is to gather Judo enthusiasts, both new and experienced, to practice and appreciate the sport. The two central tenets of our organization are a focus on the perfection of our skills, and communal prosperity both on and off the mat.\r\n     We intend on sparring under the current Olympic Judo rules, so to ensure the safety of members.

            "desc": "Falun Dafa is an ancient meditation practice in the Buddha school tradition; at the core of the practice are the values of Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance, which act as a guide for daily life and practice. Through tranquil meditations and an emphasis on the elevation of one\u2019s heart-mind character, Falun Dafa has brought health and well-being to more than 100 million people in 100 countries around the world. Falun Dafa is not a religion, there is no membership and is completely free of charge! It is a mind-body practice with a spiritual component that covers metaphysics, ethics and enlightenment. Through persistent practice one strives to achieve a state of selflessness, increased insight, inner purity, balance- true health and ultimately enlightenment. Since July 1999 the communist government of China has persecuted and enslaved millions of innocent people for practicing Falun Dafa and they comprise 65% of labor camps, detention centers and prisons across China for believing in Truth- Compassion- Forbearance. Evidence from acclaimed sources have proven tens of thousands of Falun Dafa practitioners to have been killed from live organ harvesting for China\u2019s lucrative organ transplant market. So what do we, as an organization, do on campus? We meditate together and teach the exercises, promote cultural art events that revive traditional Chinese culture and raise awareness about the persecution and organ harvesting of Falun Dafa practitioners in China.",
